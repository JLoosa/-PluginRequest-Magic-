What I want: I'd like a plugin that gives players magic, based on the episodes once upon a time.
When players press shift in slot 9, they will select the type, the name of it will be listed above the hotbar, and it will always go in a loop.



These are the Abilities:

- Smoking: press shift to teleport 15 blocks away into the direction you are looking.
A smoke like particle will appear when you disappear and reappear, based on the colour they have in the permission (hex colour code).

- Teleportation: left click to open a guy of listed players (their heads), and when you click their head, you will be teleported.
if players have teleport.block the player cannot teleport, and a message will be sent saying ''that player is too powerful''

- Fireball: launch a fireball when you left-click

- Telekinesis: left click a block and then right click in a direction to throw it. also works on players.

- Heart ripping: left click a player to rip out their heart. You will be given redstone dust, and when you right click with it the person loses half a heart.
If the player had heart.block the player can not rip out the heart and a message sent ''that player is too powerful''

- Healing: left click and the heart particle appears and heals you 3 hearts. heals everyone within a 3 block radius.

- potioncraft: left click to get a GUI of all potions that you can get.
